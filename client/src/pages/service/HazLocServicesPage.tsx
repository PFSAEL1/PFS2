// ─── FAQ ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
const FAQ = [
  {
    q: "What types of hazardous location enclosures do you service?",
    a: "We service C1D1 and C1D2 classified enclosures across a wide range of applications — including chemical processing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, industrial flammable-storage, oil and gas processing, battery energy storage, and clean room environments. Our technicians service explosion-proof fans, motors, controls, gas detection systems, and ventilation interlocks regardless of the original manufacturer.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you service gas detection equipment from any manufacturer?",
    a: "We specialize in RKI Instruments and Honeywell fixed gas detection systems, which are among the most widely deployed in industrial hazardous location applications. Calibration is performed using traceable calibration gas referenced to NIST standards, and every calibration is documented with a timestamped certificate.",
  },
  {
    q: "How often should LEL sensors be calibrated?",
    a: "Most regulatory authorities and equipment manufacturers recommend calibration at least annually, with bump testing more frequently depending on the application. OSHA 1910.307 and NFPA 70 Article 500 require that gas detection equipment in classified locations be maintained in proper working condition. In practice, many facilities calibrate quarterly to maintain insurance compliance and to catch sensor drift before it becomes a safety issue.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you provide compliance documentation after each service visit?",
    a: "Yes. Every service visit produces a complete documentation package: airflow measurements, calibration certificates with traceable calibration gas references, equipment condition photographs, maintenance records, and a written summary of findings and corrective actions. This documentation is formatted to meet OSHA, NFPA, and state fire authority inspection requirements.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer preventive maintenance contracts for hazardous location equipment?",
    a: "Yes. We offer annual and multi-year preventive maintenance contracts covering scheduled gas sensor calibration, ventilation system testing, controls inspection, and compliance documentation. Contracts are available for single facilities and multi-site operators. Priority emergency response is included for contract customers.",
  },
  {
    q: "What geographic area do you cover?",
    a: "We provide hazardous location and critical environment services nationwide. Service fees are quoted per visit; travel and lodging are billed at cost for locations outside our primary service area in Northern California. Contact us to discuss scheduling and coverage for your facility.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you service equipment you did not manufacture?",
    a: "Yes. We service the underlying safety systems — explosion-proof fans, motors, gas sensors, PLCs, and ventilation interlocks — regardless of who manufactured the enclosure. Our technicians work at the component level and are familiar with the NEC Article 500, NFPA, and OSHA standards that govern all classified location equipment.",
