    body: "Most paint booths require professional service every three to six months depending on production volume — high-throughput collision shops and industrial finishing lines may need monthly attention. Without a structured preventive maintenance program, small issues compound into costly equipment downtime, poor finish quality, and compliance violations that can trigger OSHA citations, fire marshal shutdowns, and insurance lapses. PFS offers customized PM programs built around your equipment, production schedule, and regulatory requirements — whether you operate a single collision shop, a multi-location fleet, or a full aerospace finishing line. Because PFS is the original manufacturer of your booth, our factory-trained technicians know your system better than any third-party service company. We carry OEM parts, understand your airflow design, and can identify wear patterns before they become failures. Our PM visits cover filter inspection and replacement, fan motor and belt condition, electrical and controls checks, airflow measurement and balancing, fire suppression system integrity, and a full written service report that satisfies insurance carriers, fire marshals, and OSHA inspectors. For California customers, our technicians are familiar with CARB air quality regulations, South Coast AQMD and Bay Area AQMD requirements, and California OSHA spray finishing standards — so your booth stays compliant with both state and federal requirements. For industrial and aerospace customers, we extend the same rigorous PM standards to conveyor systems, powder coating lines, robotic finishing cells, and large-format ovens — giving your production team a single point of contact for all maintenance needs.",

    body: "When your spray booth or finishing system goes down, every hour of downtime costs you money. For collision repair chains and fleet operators, a downed booth means delayed vehicles, missed deadlines, and frustrated customers. For aerospace and industrial production lines, equipment failure can mean halted contracts, missed delivery windows, and compliance violations that compound the problem. PFS maintains a team of factory-trained field service technicians ready to respond to emergency paint booth repair calls across North America — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Unlike third-party service companies, we are the original manufacturer of your equipment. That means we arrive with OEM parts, accurate wiring diagrams, and a deep understanding of your system’s design — ready to resolve the problem, not just diagnose it. Our emergency response process begins with a rapid diagnostic assessment to identify the root cause — whether it’s airflow failure, burner malfunction, electrical fault, controls failure, or contamination. We then execute the repair using OEM parts and industry best practices, followed by comprehensive testing to verify optimal performance before we leave your facility. For California customers, our technicians understand the additional complexity of CARB air quality regulations and California OSHA spray finishing standards — so emergency repairs are completed in a way that keeps you compliant. Common emergency service calls include booth fan motor failure, burner ignition failure, control panel faults, filter system blockage, exhaust system failure, and fire suppression system alarms.

    body: "Aging finishing equipment doesn’t always need to be replaced — it often needs to be modernized. PFS offers a comprehensive range of spray booth retrofit and upgrade services that extend equipment service life, improve energy efficiency, reduce operating costs, and bring older systems into compliance with current NFPA 33, OSHA, EPA, and ETL standards. High energy costs are one of the most common drivers for retrofit projects. Inefficient exhaust fans, outdated heating systems, and undersized makeup air units waste significant energy every operating hour. PFS can optimize your airflow system, upgrade to variable frequency drive (VFD) fan controls, and replace legacy burners with high-efficiency units — reducing energy consumption without sacrificing booth performance. LED lighting upgrades are among the most cost-effective retrofits available. Modern LED tube fixtures deliver superior color rendering for finish inspection, consume a fraction of the energy of fluorescent systems, and last significantly longer — reducing both energy costs and maintenance labor. For compliance-driven upgrades, PFS addresses NFPA 33 violations, OSHA 1910.107 deficiencies, and California CARB or AQMD permit conditions identified during inspections. We replace outdated control panels with modern UL508A-listed enclosures, upgrade fire suppression systems, and install current-generation safety interlocks and monitoring systems. For industrial and aerospace customers, we also upgrade controls and automation systems on existing finishing lines — integrating new PLC platforms, digital flow controls, and Industry 4.0 monitoring systems without requiring full equipment replacement. Every retrofit project begins with a site assessment and written scope of work, so you know exactly what will be done and what it will cost before work begins.",

Our inspection process follows a systematic, factory-defined protocol: a comprehensive evaluation of airflow performance, filtration condition, electrical safety, fire suppression system integrity, burner and heating system function, and full NFPA 33 compliance review. We also verify compliance with OSHA 1910.107 spray finishing standards and, for California facilities, CARB air quality regulations and applicable AQMD permit conditions. For industrial and aerospace facilities, our inspections extend to integrated finishing systems, conveyor lines, powder coating systems, and large-format ovens — with reports formatted to meet facility compliance audits and customer quality system requirements.
