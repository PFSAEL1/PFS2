              Los Angeles County and the South Coast Air Basin operate under South Coast AQMD — one of the strictest air quality management districts in the United States. Spray finishing operations in LA County must comply with Rule 1151 (Motor Vehicle and Mobile Equipment Non-Assembly Line Coating Operations) and related South Coast AQMD rules governing VOC emissions, transfer efficiency, and spray booth equipment standards.
