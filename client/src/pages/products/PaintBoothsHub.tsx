          acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "A cross-flow booth draws air horizontally from the front intake wall to the rear exhaust filters — the most cost-effective configuration. A downdraft booth draws air vertically downward from a ceiling plenum through a raised grated floor, producing the cleanest airflow pattern and the highest finish quality. Semi-downdraft and side-downdraft are intermediate options that balance cost and performance." }

Entry-level cross-flow booths start around $15,000–$30,000. Full downdraft booths with heated air make-up units typically range from $50,000–$150,000+. Large aircraft or drive-through booths can exceed $500,000. Contact PFS for a factory-direct quote." }

For automotive work, a standard 14 ft × 9 ft × 26 ft booth accommodates most passenger vehicles. Trucks, buses, and heavy equipment require custom sizing. PFS engineers can size a booth to your specific part envelope and production volume." }

          acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "A heated paint booth accelerates cure times, improves finish quality, and is required for waterborne basecoat/clearcoat systems that need a flash-bake cycle. Non-heated booths are suitable for ambient-cure coatings and lower-volume operations. In cold climates, a heated air make-up unit is often necessary year-round to maintain proper spray conditions." }
