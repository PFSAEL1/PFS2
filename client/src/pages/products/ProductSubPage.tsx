Proper heated airflow is critical for paint atomization, solvent flash-off, and consistent finish quality — especially in cold climates or high-production environments.\n\nAvailable in three heater configurations:\n\n• Natural Gas Heaters — The most common choice for production shops. Direct-fired or indirect-fired gas burners deliver high BTU output with low operating cost. Ideal for facilities with existing gas infrastructure.\n\n• Propane Heaters — Identical performance to natural gas units, configured for propane supply. Preferred for remote facilities, outdoor booths, and locations without natural gas service.\n\n• Electric Heaters — Clean, zero-emission heating with no combustion. Ideal for environmentally sensitive facilities, clean rooms, and locations where gas is not available. Lower BTU ceiling than gas but precise digital temperature control.",

No pit required means faster installation, lower site prep costs, and the ability to install in existing buildings with slab-on-grade floors.\n\nAvailable in heated and non-heated configurations.
