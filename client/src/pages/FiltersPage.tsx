const FAQ_ITEMS = [
  {
    q: "How often should I replace my spray booth filters?",
    a: "Exhaust filter replacement frequency depends on production volume and the type of coating being applied. Most collision repair shops replace exhaust filters every 30–90 days. High-volume production environments may require monthly or more frequent replacement. Intake filters typically last longer — 3 to 6 months under normal conditions. PFS recommends inspecting filters at every PM visit and replacing them when pressure drop across the filter bank exceeds manufacturer specifications.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if I run my spray booth with clogged filters?",
    a: "Clogged filters restrict airflow, reducing face velocity below the 100 FPM minimum required by NFPA 33. This creates several problems: finish quality degrades due to turbulent or insufficient airflow, overspray accumulates on booth surfaces and equipment creating a fire hazard, fan motors work harder and wear faster, and your booth may fail inspection. Replacing filters on schedule is one of the most cost-effective maintenance tasks you can perform.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are your filters NFPA 33 compliant?",
    a: "Yes. PFS exhaust and intake filter media meets the requirements of NFPA 33 Standard for Spray Application Using Flammable or Combustible Materials. Our filters are designed to maintain the airflow performance your booth requires while capturing overspray at the efficiency levels required by code.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you supply filters for booths you didn't manufacture?",
    a: "Yes. PFS supplies replacement filters for most major spray booth brands including Global Finishing Solutions, Col-Met, Garmat, Blowtherm, Spraybake, and others. Contact us with your booth make, model, and filter dimensions and we will identify the correct replacement media.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I order filters online?",
    a: "Yes — PFS filters are available for online ordering at pfsfilters.com. For large orders, fleet accounts, or custom-cut media, call us directly at (888) 545-7715 and our parts team will get you set up.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Filter Rotation Program?",
    a: "The PFS Filter Rotation Program is a scheduled replacement service where we track your filter life, ship replacement media on a schedule matched to your production volume, and coordinate filter changes with your PM visits. It eliminates the risk of running with clogged filters and removes filter procurement from your to-do list.",

                Spray booth filters are not a commodity — the wrong media can reduce airflow below the 100 FPM face velocity required by NFPA 33, create fire hazards from overspray accumulation, and produce finish defects that cost far more than the filter itself. As the original manufacturer of PFS spray booths, we stock the exact filter specifications your equipment requires.

                The PFS Filter Rotation Program is a scheduled replacement service designed for collision repair shops, fleet operators, and high-volume production facilities that cannot afford the cost of running with clogged or degraded filter media. We track your filter life based on your production volume and booth specifications, ship replacement media on a schedule matched to your operation, and coordinate filter changes with your preventive maintenance visits.
              </p>
              <p style={{

                marginBottom: "1.5rem",
              }}>
                Program participants receive priority parts availability, volume pricing on filter media, and a dedicated account contact who knows your equipment specifications. For multi-location fleets, we coordinate filter supply and scheduling across all sites — one call, one invoice, one point of contact.
