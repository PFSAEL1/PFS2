        <p>
          Because many PFS products are engineered or manufactured specifically for each customer, returns are limited.

        <h4>Return Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Prior written Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) is required.</li>
          <li>Return requests must be made within thirty (30) days of delivery unless otherwise approved.</li>
          <li>Products must be unopened, unused, uninstalled, and returned in their original factory packaging.</li>
          <li>Products must be in new, resalable condition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Non-Returnable Products</h4>
        <p>The following items are not eligible for return:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Custom-engineered products</li>
          <li>Made-to-order equipment</li>
          <li>Modified equipment</li>
          <li>Special-order products</li>
          <li>Fabricated assemblies</li>
          <li>Clearance or discontinued products</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once engineering, procurement, or fabrication has begun, custom equipment is non-cancelable and non-returnable unless otherwise agreed to in writing by PFS.
        </p>

        <h4>Restocking Fee</h4>
        <p>
          Approved returns are subject to a <strong>forty percent (40%) restocking fee</strong>, which covers inspection, testing, handling, repackaging, administrative processing, and inventory costs.
        </p>

        <h4>Freight</h4>
        <p>The purchaser is responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All outbound freight charges.</li>
          <li>All return freight.</li>
          <li>Packaging and insurance.</li>
          <li>Any damage occurring during return shipment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Shipping charges, installation, expedited freight, and service charges are non-refundable.</p>

        <h4>Inspection</h4>
        <p>
          PFS reserves the right to inspect all returned products. Items that are used, damaged, altered, improperly packaged, incomplete, or otherwise not in resalable condition may be refused or may receive a reduced refund at PFS's sole discretion.
        </p>

        <h4>Refunds</h4>
        <p>
          Approved refunds or credits will generally be processed after inspection and approval, less applicable restocking fees and other authorized deductions.
